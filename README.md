## History of Conway's game of Life
Conway's game of Life was created by John Conway in 1970. It is the most famous example of a cellular automaton. It has been created after Conway got interested in a mathematical problem made by John von Neumann that was about creating a mathematical model that could build copies of itself.

**This game is autoplayed: we don't need the user to act on the interface except at the beginning to launch the game.**
## Description of the project
The aim of this project is to re-create the famous game invented by John Conway. The game is really simple and is composed of 3 basic rules: 
  - Living cell with < 2 living neighbors dies
  - Living cell with > 3 living neighbors dies
  - Dead cell with 3 living neighbors comes to life
We added two more rules:
  - Living cell with 2 or 3 living neighbors continues to live
  - Dead cell with not exactly 3 living neighbors stays dead

## Features
 -  Create cells by clicking on the window: When the user clicks on the window, cells are created.
 -  Paint button for easier cell creation: Provide a paint button to facilitate the creation of cells in a more convenient way.
 -  Create a grid with random cells: Generate a grid with randomly populated cells, allowing users to manage density using a slider.
 -  Reset with an empty grid: Include a button to reset the grid and start with an empty state.
 -  Import existing files like CSV and text: Enable the ability to import files in formats such as CSV and plain text.
 -  Run, pause, and speed buttons: Provide buttons to control the simulation, allowing users to run, pause, and adjust the speed.
 -  Zoom in and zoom out checkbox: Include a checkbox to enable zooming in and out of the grid.
 -  Save as text or CSV: Allow users to save the grid and its contents as either a text file or a CSV file.
